# WolfHire
The WolfHire program is a hiring system where the user can add job postings as an employer, or the user can apply to jobs as a candidate for the job.  The employer can add any amount of jobs, put candidates through multiple states of the hiring process (interviewing, rejected...). The candidate can add, edit, or remove an application on any job.

# To run the program:
1) Run program as a java application.
2) You can either add your own jobs and applications, or load from a previously made file of jobs and applications.

3) To run it with your own inputs of jobs and applications: Click "File" in the top left, click **"Add Position"** to add a position, and then the users can start adding job applications to that position.
4) To run with a previously made file of jobs and applications: Click "File" in the top left, click **"Load Positions File"** --> **"test-files"** --> **"positions1.txt"** to load the positions

   Program should look like this:
