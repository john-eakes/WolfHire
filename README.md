# WolfHire
The WolfHire program is a hiring system where the user can add job postings as an employer, or the user can apply to jobs as a candidate for the job.  The employer can add any amount of jobs, put candidates through multiple states of the hiring process (interviewing, rejected...). The candidate can add, edit, or remove an application on any job.
